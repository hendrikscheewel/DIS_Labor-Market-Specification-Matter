abstract = {We study the effects of immigration on native welfare in a general equilibrium model featuring two skill types, search frictions, wage bargaining, and a redistributive welfare state. Our quantitative analysis suggests that, in all 20 countries studied, immigration attenuates the effects of search frictions. These gains tend to outweigh the welfare costs of redistribution. Immigration has increased native welfare in almost all countries. Both high-skilled and low-skilled natives benefit in two thirds of countries, contrary to what models without search frictions predict. Median total gains from migration are 1.19{\%} and 1.00{\%} for high and low skilled natives, respectively.},

Two countries sharing identical characteristics may end up in either a “low poverty-low brain drain” equilibrium or in a “high poverty-high brain drain” equilibrium. In this paper, we build a model which endogenizes high-skilled emigration and economic performances in order to derive the conditions under which multiplicity occurs. After identifying country-specific parameters, we find that in the majority of developing countries, the best equilibrium is selected and that the observed brain drain is inevitable. In 22 small developing countries however, the worse equilibrium prevails, implying that poverty and brain drain are increased by coordination failure. These countries require appropriate development policies, such as a temporary subsidization of the repatriation of their high-skilled expatriates. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a brain gain mechanism.},

American Economic Review 95 (March), 25-49] argues that the textbook equilibrium search model of unemployment explains less than 10{\%} of the volatility in US vacancies and unemployment when fluctuations are driven by productivity shocks. His paper as well as other recent work inspired by it are reviewed and extended here. Although there seems to be excessive feedback from the job-finding rate to the wage built into the Nash bargaining mechanism assumed to determine wages in the model, we argue that he and others overemphasize the need for wage rigidity to explain the data on labor-market fluctuations. Indeed, a modified version of the model can explain the magnitude of the empirical relationship between the vacancy-unemployment ratio and labor productivity when wages are the outcome of a strategic bargaining game and when the elasticity of the matching function and the opportunity cost of a match are set at reasonable values. The modified model also explains almost two thirds of the volatility in the ratio relative to that of productivity when separation shocks are taken into account, as well as the strong negative correlation between vacancies and unemployment found in Shimer's data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a model of human capital accumulation that features a nondegenerate distribution of educational attainment in the population. We use this framework to assess the quantitative contribution of technological progress and changes in life expectancy in explaining the evolution of educational attainment. The model implies an increase in average years of schooling of 24{\%}, which is the increase observed in the data. We find that technological variables and in particular skill‐biased technical change represent the most important factors in accounting for the increase in educational attainment. The strong response of schooling to changes in income is informative about the potential role of educational policy and the impact of other trends affecting lifetime income.},

We compare welfare under the observed levels of migration to a no-migration counterfactual. In the long run, natives in countries that received a lot of migration-such as Canada or Australia-are better off due to greater product variety available in consumption and as intermediate inputs. In the short run, the impact of migration on average welfare in these countries is close to zero, while the skilled and unskilled natives tend to experience welfare changes of opposite signs. The remaining natives in countries with large emigration flows-such as Jamaica or El Salvador-are also better off due to migration, but for a different reason: remittances. The welfare impact of observed levels of migration is substantial, at about 5{\%} to 10{\%} for the main receiving countries and about 10{\%} in countries with large incoming remittances.},

This paper extends a two-country model of inter- and intra-industry trade to a rich environment featuring technological differences, skill differences and the possibility of international labor mobility. The model is used to explain the patterns of trade and migration as countries remove barriers to trade and to labor mobility. We parameterize the model to match the features of the Western and Eastern European members of the EU and analyze first the effects of the trade liberalization which occurred between 1989 and 2004, and then the gains and losses from migration which are expected to occur if legal barriers to labor mobility are substantially reduced. The lower barriers to migration would result in significant migration of skilled workers from Eastern European countries. Interestingly, this would not only benefit the migrants and most Western European workers but, via trade, it would also benefit the workers remaining in Eastern Europe. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the extent and consequences of this potential misallocation in the context of a simple two-location growth model, in which production requires capital, labor and an essential immobile factor (land). We characterize the magnitude of labor movements implied by an efficient long-run allocation, and derive their implications for capital accumulation. Quantitatively, even for moderate TFP differences, we find substantial increases in world output associated with efficient allocations. These output increases are driven by large movements of labor from low to high TFP countries, as well as by a sizeable increase in the capital stock and changes in its endogenous division across countries. Our results are robust to a large set of parameter values, including unrealistically conservative ones.},

We build a general equilibrium model, endogenizing bilateral migration and income disparities between and within countries. Our calibration strategy uses data on effective and potential migration to identify total migration costs and visa costs by education level. Data on potential migration reveal that the number of people in the world who have a desire to migrate is around 400 million. This number is much smaller than that predicted in previous studies, and reflects the existence of high “incompressible” migration costs. In our benchmark framework, liberalizing migration increases the world GDP by 11.5–12.5 percent in the medium term. Our robustness analysis reveals that the gains are always limited, in the range of 7.0 percent (with schooling externalities) to 17.9 percent (if network effects are accounted for).},

The estimated gains from removing immigration restrictions are huge.

@article{Krugman1980a,
abstract = {For some time now there has been con-siderable skepticism about the ability of comparative cost theory to explain the ac-tual pattern of international trade. Neither the extensive trade among the industrial countries, nor the prevalence in this trade of two-way exchanges of differentiated prod-ucts, make much sense in terms of standard theory. As a result, many people have con-cluded that a new framework for analyzing trade is needed.' The main elements of such a framework-economies of scale, the pos-sibility of product differentiation, and im-perfect competition-have been discussed by such authors as Bela Balassa, Herbert Grubel (1967,1970), and Irving Kravis, and have been "in the air" for many years. In this paper I present a simple formal analysis which incorporates these elements, and show how it can be used to shed some light on some issues which cannot be handled in more conventional models. These include, in particular, the causes of trade between economies with similar factor endowments, and the role of a large domestic market in encouraging exports. The basic model of this paper is one in which there are economies of scale in pro-duction and firms can costlessly differenti-ate their products. In this model, which is derived from recent work by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz, equilibrium takes the form of Chamberlinian monopolistic com-petition: each firm has some monopoly power, but entry drives monopoly profits to zero. When two imperfectly competitive economies of this kind are allowed to trade, increasing returns produce trade and gains from trade even if the economies have iden-tical tastes, technology, and factor endow-ments. This basic model of trade is pre-sented in Section I. It is closely related to a model I have developed elsewhere; in this paper a somewhat more restrictive formula-tion of demand is used to make the analysis in later sections easier. The rest of the paper is concerned with two extensions of the basic model. In Sec-tion II, I examine the effect of transporta-tion costs, and show that countries with larger domestic markets will, other things equal, have higher wage rates. Section III then deals with "home market" effects on trade patterns. It provides a formal justifica-tion for the commonly made argument that countries will tend to export those goods for which they have relatively large domestic markets. This paper makes no pretense of general-ity. The models presented rely on extremely restrictive assumptions about cost and util-ity. Nonetheless, it is to be hoped that the paper provides some useful insights into those aspects of international trade which simply cannot be treated in our usual models. I. The Basic Model},

Contribution: Search and matching model that allows for skill-complementarities and heterogeneous complementarities to capital.

Notable differences: no public budget -{\textgreater} no redistribution -{\textgreater} no fiscal effect?

Countries covered: USA

Model features:
- search and matching model,

- Skill heterogeneity: among natives and immigrants, allows to analyze distributional effects on different skill groups,

- Differential search cost between natives and immigrants: main driver for wage gap, immigrants then have lower outside options -{\textgreater} accept lower wages -{\textgreater} lower average wages that firms have to pay -{\textgreater} more job entry -{\textgreater} better bargaining position of natives;

- Capital-skill complementarity: capital is introduced as complementary factor; additional channel of adjustment to immigration-induced changes in labor supply

- Generalized production technology: Allows for analysis of impact of immigration under different assumptions regarding the degree of capital skill, within-skill, and across-skill complementarity

abstract = {In this paper, we simulate the labor market effects of net immigration and emigration during the 1990's in all OECD countries. To accomplish this, we are the first to employ a comprehensive database of migrant stocks, grouped by education level and country of origin/destination, for the years 1990 and 2000. Due to the much higher international mobility of college graduates, relative to all other individuals, we find that net migration flows are college-intensive, relative to the population of non-migrants. Using the consensus aggregate model of labor demand and supply we simulate the long-run employment and wage effects of immigration and emigration. We use a range of parameter values spanning most of the estimates in the literature. In all cases we find that immigration had a positive effect on the wage of less educated natives. It also increased or left the average native wages unchanged and had a positive or no effect on native employment. To the contrary, emigration had a negative effect on the wage of less educated native workers and it contributed to increase within country inequality in all OECD countries. These results still hold true when we correct for the estimates of undocumented immigrants, for the skill-downgrading of immigrants, when we focus on immigration from non-OECD countries, and when we consider preliminary measures of more recent immigration flows for the period 2000-2007.},

abstract = {By exploiting a commuting policy that led to a sharp and unexpected inflow of Czech workers to areas along the German-Czech border, we examine the impact of an exogenous immigration-induced labor supply shock on local wages and employment of natives. On average, the supply shock leads to a moderate decline in local native wages and a sharp decline in local native employment. These average effects mask considerable heterogeneity across groups: while younger natives experience larger wage effects, employment responses are particularly pronounced for older natives. This pattern is inconsistent with standard models of immigration but can be accounted for by a model that allows for a larger labor supply elasticity or a higher degree of wage rigidity for older than for young workers. We further show that the employment response is almost entirely driven by diminished inflows of natives into work rather than outflows into other areas or non-employment, suggesting that “outsiders” shield “insiders” from the increased competition.},

abstract = {In this article we estimate the wage and employment effects of recent immigration in Western Germany. Using administrative data for the period 1987-2001 and a labor-market equilibrium model, we find that the substantial immigration of the 1990s had very little adverse effects on native wages and on their employment levels. Instead, it had a sizeable adverse employment effect on previous immigrants as well as a small adverse effect on their wages. These asymmetric results are partly driven by a higher degree of substitution between old and new immigrants in the labor market and in part by the rigidity of wages in less than flexible labor markets. In a simple counter-factual experiment we show that in a world of perfect wage flexibility and no unemployment insurance the wage-bill loss of old immigrants would be much smaller. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7{\%}, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.

We derive a flexible empirical strategy that does not rely on pre-allocating immigrants to particular skill groups. In our empirical analysis, we demonstrate that immigrants downgrade considerably upon arrival. As for the effects on native wages, we find that immigration depresses wages below the 20th percentile of the wage distribution, but leads to slight wage increases in the upper part of the wage$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndistribution. The overall wage effect of immigration is slightly positive. The positive wage effects we find are, although modest, too large to be explained by an$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimmigration surplus.

@article{Cohen-Goldner2011,
abstract = {This paper studies the short and medium run impact of highly skilled immigrants from the Former Soviet Union to Israel on natives' wages and employment. If immigrants are relatively good substitutes for native workers, the impact of immigration will be largest immediately upon the immigrants' arrival, and may become smaller as the labor market adjusts to the supply shock. Conversely, if immigrants upon arrival are poor substitutes for natives, the initial effect of immigration is small, and increases over time as immigrants acquire local labor market skills and compete with native workers. We empirically examine these alternative hypotheses using data from Israel between 1989 and 1999.We find that wages of both men and women are negatively correlated with the fraction of immigrants with little local experience in a labor market segment. A 10 percent increase in the share of immigrants lowers natives' wages in the short run by 1-3 percent, but this effect dissolves after 4-7 years. This result is robust to a variety of different segmentations of the labor market, to the inclusion of cohort effects, and to different dynamic structures in the residual term of the wage equation. On the other hand, we do not find any effect of immigration on employment, neither in the short nor in the medium run. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Krugman1980,
abstract = {For some time now there has been con-siderable skepticism about the ability of comparative cost theory to explain the ac-tual pattern of international trade. Neither the extensive trade among the industrial countries, nor the prevalence in this trade of two-way exchanges of differentiated prod-ucts, make much sense in terms of standard theory. As a result, many people have con-cluded that a new framework for analyzing trade is needed.' The main elements of such a framework-economies of scale, the pos-sibility of product differentiation, and im-perfect competition-have been discussed by such authors as Bela Balassa, Herbert Grubel (1967,1970), and Irving Kravis, and have been "in the air" for many years. In this paper I present a simple formal analysis which incorporates these elements, and show how it can be used to shed some light on some issues which cannot be handled in more conventional models. These include, in particular, the causes of trade between economies with similar factor endowments, and the role of a large domestic market in encouraging exports. The basic model of this paper is one in which there are economies of scale in pro-duction and firms can costlessly differenti-ate their products. In this model, which is derived from recent work by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz, equilibrium takes the form of Chamberlinian monopolistic com-petition: each firm has some monopoly power, but entry drives monopoly profits to zero. When two imperfectly competitive economies of this kind are allowed to trade, increasing returns produce trade and gains from trade even if the economies have iden-tical tastes, technology, and factor endow-ments. This basic model of trade is pre-sented in Section I. It is closely related to a model I have developed elsewhere; in this paper a somewhat more restrictive formula-tion of demand is used to make the analysis in later sections easier. The rest of the paper is concerned with two extensions of the basic model. In Sec-tion II, I examine the effect of transporta-tion costs, and show that countries with larger domestic markets will, other things equal, have higher wage rates. Section III then deals with "home market" effects on trade patterns. It provides a formal justifica-tion for the commonly made argument that countries will tend to export those goods for which they have relatively large domestic markets. This paper makes no pretense of general-ity. The models presented rely on extremely restrictive assumptions about cost and util-ity. Nonetheless, it is to be hoped that the paper provides some useful insights into those aspects of international trade which simply cannot be treated in our usual models. I. The Basic Model},

Our analysis relies on a computable general equilibrium model combining the major interactions between immigrants and natives (labor market impact, fiscal impact, capital deepening, endogenous education, endogenous inequality). Contrary to recent studies, we show that immigration induced important net gains and small redistributive effects among natives. According to our simulations, the postwar US immigration is beneficial for all natives cohorts and all skill groups. Nevertheless, the gains would have been larger if the US had conducted a more selective immigration policy.},

Nevertheless, there is controversy over the appropriate$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntheoretical and empirical framework for measuring the presumed effect, and over the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprecise magnitudes involved. This paper offers an overview and synthesis of existing$\backslash$r$\backslash$nknowledge on the relationship between immigration and inequality, focusing on evidence$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom cross-city comparisons in the U.S. While some researchers have claimed that a$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncross-city research design is inherently flawed, I argue that the evidence from cross-city$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncomparisons is remarkably consistent with recent findings based on aggregate time$\backslash$r$\backslash$nseries data. In particular, cross-city and aggregate time series comparisons provide$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsupport for three key conclusions: (1) workers with below high school education are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nperfect substitutes for those with a high school education; (2) “high school equivalent”$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand “college equivalent” workers are imperfect substitutes, with an elasticity of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsubstitution on the order of 2; (3) within education groups, immigrants and natives are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimperfect substitutes. Together these results imply that the average impacts of recent$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimmigrant inflows on the relative wages of U.S. natives are small. The effects on overall$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwage inequality (including natives and immigrants) are larger, reflecting the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nconcentration of immigrants in the tails of the skill distribution and higher residual$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninequality among immigrants than natives. Even so, immigration accounts for a small$\backslash$r$\backslash$nshare (5{\%}) of the increase in U.S. wage inequality between 1980 and 2000.},

In fact, we find evidence of a negative impact of immigration on “compositional amenities.”In communities with larger immigration influx, Austrian children commute longer distances to school, and fewer daycare resources are provided.

abstract = {Two large but separate bodies of literature analyze the economic effects of international trade and immigration. Given that several factors are important determinants of both trade and migration flows, the previous studies are vulnerable to a potentially serious omitted-variables bias, questioning the validity of existing estimates of the effects of trade and immigration on income. This paper provides estimates of the effects of trade and immigration on income in a unified framework. We also provide a useful decomposition of the channels at work in terms of the employment rate, the capital intensity, and total factor productivity of the receiving economy. We assemble panel data on immigration flows, output, employment and capital stocks for thirty OECD countries over the period 1980-2007. In order to identify the causal effects of trade and immigration on economic outcomes we adopt and extend the gravity-based approach in Frankel and Romer (1999). Our predictors for trade and immigration flows are based on geography and the demographic trends of each country's trade and migration partners. We find that immigration has a large, positive effect on the employment rate of the receiving country. However, it leaves income per capita unaffected because of an offsetting negative effect on TFP. In contrast, trade flows appear to increase income per capita, mainly through TFP growth, and have no impact on the employment rate. The positive employment effect of immigration is the most robust of all the effects identified in this paper.},

Immigration has increased native welfare in almost all countries.

abstract = {The net fiscal impact of immigration is typically estimated as the difference between the taxes and other contributions migrants make to public finances and the costs of the public benefits and services they receive. This impact depends on the characteristics of migrants, their impacts on the labour market and the characteristics and rules of the welfare system, among other factors. In theory, migrants who are young, skilled and doing highly-paid jobs are likely to make a more positive net fiscal contribution than those with low skills and low labour market participation rates. The evidence suggests that the fiscal impact of migration in the UK is small (less than +/-1{\%} of GDP) and differs by migrant group (e.g. EEA migrants vs non-EEA migrants, recent migrants vs all migrants). The existing results are subject to numerous key assumptions. The Office for Budget Responsibility suggests higher net migration reduces pressure on government debt over time. This result is based on the assumption that incoming migrants are more likely to be of working age than the population in general. Cross-country evidence for the years 2007-2009 suggests that the fiscal impact of migration in the UK (+ 0.46{\%} of GDP) was greater than the fiscal impact of migration in 16 other OECD countries. The UK occupies the 11th position (out of 27 countries) in regards to the positive fiscal impact of migration across OECD countries. This briefing provides an overview of the existing estimates on the impact of immigration on government finances for the UK and other countries and explores the conceptual and methodological issues related to estimating the fiscal impact of immigration.},

New in this literature we calculate the wage effect of emigration as well as immigration. We focus on Europe and compare the outcomes for large Western European countries with those of other key destination countries both in the OECD and outside the OECD. Our analysis builds on an improved database of bilateral stocks and net migration flows of immigrants and emigrants by education level for the years 1990 through 2000. We find that all European countries experienced a decrease in their average wages and a worsening of their wage inequality because of emigration. Whereas, contrary to the popular belief, immigration had nearly equal but opposite effects: positive on average wages and reducing wage inequality of non-movers. These patterns hold true using a range of parameters for our simulations, accounting for the estimates of undocumented immigrants, and correcting for the quality of schooling and/or labor-market downgrading of skills. In terms of wage outcomes, it follows that prevalent public fears in European countries are misplaced; immigration has had a positive average wage effect on native workers. Some concerns should be focused on the wage effect of emigration, instead.},

The model is calibrated to match the economic and demographic characteristics of the 34 OECD countries and the rest of the world, as well as trade flows between them in the year 2010. We show that recent migration flows have been beneficial for 69{\%} of the non-migrant OECD population, and for 83{\%} of non-migrant citizens of the 22 richest OECD countries. Winners are mainly residing in traditional immigration countries; their gains are substantial and are essentially due to the entry of immigrants from non-OECD countries. Although labor market and fiscal effects are non-negligible in some countries, the greatest source of gain comes from the market size effect, i.e. the change in the variety of goods available to consumers.},

The elasticity of labor supply to wages is usually found to be small (Evers et al., 2008). However, endogenizing labor supply matters if the participation rates of natives and immigrants are strongly different. A recent OECD report (OECD, 2015) indicates that immigrants from developing countries exhibit smaller participation rates than natives in Europe (in particular, low-skilled women from Muslim coun- tries). Although these immigrants represent a small fraction of the working-age pop- ulation, accounting for differences in participation rates can attenuate the magnitude of the labor market and market size effects. Dealing with heterogeneous participa- tion rates is a non-trivial extension, which requires a more general utility function with leisure, and calibrating origin-specific preference parameters (i.e. relaxing the hypothesis of homegenous preferences).

abstract = {This paper examines the economic impact of the second great immigration wave (1945–2000) on the US economy. Our analysis relies on a computable general equilibrium model combining the major interactions between immigrants and natives (labor market impact, fiscal impact, capital deepening, endogenous education, endogenous inequality). Contrary to recent studies, we show that immigration induced important net gains and small redistributive effects among natives. According to our simulations, the postwar US immigration is beneficial for all natives cohorts and all skill groups. Nevertheless, the gains would have been larger if the US had conducted a more selective immigration policy.},

@article{Auerbach1999,
abstract = {This article reconsiders the fiscal impact of immigrants over time, using the technique of generational accounting introduced by Auerbach et al. (1991) and applied subsequently by a number of others. The authors concluded: first, whether immigration contributes to or helps alleviate fiscal stress depends on the extent to which that stress will be borne by future generations. Second, when a policy of 'fiscal responsibility' is followed, the fiscal gain from immigration is reduced. Third, the impact of immigration on fiscal balances is extremely small relative to the size of the overall imbalance itself. Thus, immigration should be viewed neither as a major source of the existing imbalance nor as a potential solution to it.},

@article{Ottaviano2012,
abstract = {This paper calculates the effects of immigration on the wages of native US workers of various skill levels in two steps. In the first step we use labor demand functions to estimate the elasticity of substitution across different groups of workers. Second, we use the underlying production structure and the estimated elasticities to calculate the total wage effects of immigration in the long run. We emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine own-group effects with cross-group effects in order to obtain the total wage effects for each native group. In order to obtain a parsimonious representation of elasticities that can be estimated with available data, we adopt alternative nested-CES models and let the data select the preferred specification. New to this paper is the estimate of the substitutability between natives and immigrants of similar education and experience levels. In the data-preferred model, there is a small but significant degree of imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants which, when combined with the other estimated elasticities, implies that in the period from 1990 to 2006 immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between 0.6{\%} and +1.7{\%}). It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6{\%}) and a substantial negative effect (-6.7{\%}) on wages of previous immigrants in the long run},

@article{Brucker2014,
abstract = {We investigate the labor market effects of immigration in Denmark, Germany and the UK, three countries which are characterized by considerable differences in labor market institutions and welfare states. Institutions such as collective bargaining, minimum wages, employment protection and unemployment benefits affect the way in which wages respond to labor supply shocks, and, hence, the labor market effects of immigration. We employ a wage-setting approach which assumes that wages decline with the unemployment rate, albeit imperfectly. We find that the wage and employment effects of immigration depend on wage flexibility and the composition of the labor supply shock. In Germany immigration involves only moderate wage, but large unemployment effects, since immigrants are concentrated in labor market segments with low wage flexibility. The reverse is true for the UK and Denmark. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper performs a meta-analysis of empirical estimates of uncompensated labour supply elasticities. For the Netherlands, we find that an elasticity of 0.5 for women and 0.1 for men is a good reflection of what the literature reveals. The elasticity for men hardly differs between countries, but for women some cross-country variation is found. The increasing participation rate of women may lead to a somewhat lower elasticity in the future. Both the specification of the hours function and the estimation method are found to affect elasticity estimates.},

abstract = {This essay revisits the argument that the removal of worldwide immigration restrictions would induce a very large increase in world GDP. The recent books Exodus: How Migration is Changing Our World by Paul Collier and The Price of Rights: Regulating International Labor Migration by Martin Ruhs raise a number of questions about the underlying economic model. The essay shows how these concerns can greatly attenuate the predicted gains. ( JEL F22, F66, J11, J18, J61)},

@article{Card2001,
abstract = {This article uses 1990 census data to study the effects of immigrant inflows on occupation‐specific labor market outcomes. I find that intercity mobility rates of natives and earlier immigrants are insensitive to immigrant inflows. However, occupation‐specific wages and employment rates are systematically lower in cities with higher relative supplies of workers in a given occupation. The results imply that immigrant inflows over the 1980s reduced wages and employment rates of low‐skilled natives in traditional gateway cities like Miami and Los Angeles by 1–3 percentage points.

annote = {* "I find that intercity mobility rates of natives and earlier immigrants are insensitive to immigrant inflows. However, occupation-specific wages and employment rates are systematically lower in cities with higher relative supplies of workers in a given occupation."
* "There are three key conceptual problems in the cross-market approach: (1) an increase in the fraction of immigrants in a city does not necessarily raise the supply of low-skilled labor, since natives may move out in response to immigrant inflows; (2) the cross-sectional correlation between immigrant inflows and native wages may be upward-biased by local demand shocks that raise wages and attract in-migrants; (3) in the long run, an immigration-induced increase in the supply of labor to a particular city can be diffused accoss the economy by intercity trade."
* "To proceed, I make the simplifying assumption that local labor markets are stratified along occupation lines. Assuming a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) technology, the fraction of a city's population who would normally be expected to work in a given occupation provides a summary measure of relative local labor market competition facing that group. Within this framework, immigrant inflows affect the structure of wages by raising or lowering the relative population shares of different occupation groups. An inflow of immigrants that raises the fraction of the population in a particular group would be expected to put downward pressure on wages an employment rates for workers in the group. On the other hand, a balanced inflow of immigrants that leaves the relative population shares unchanged would not be expected to affect the relative wage structure."
* **Why not using occupation instead of education for building groups?:** "One potentially appealing assumption is that labor markets are stratified along occupation lines and that individuals who work in the same occupation are perfect substitutes with each other regardless of their gender or national origin. A problem with this assumption is that individuals can move between occupations, and they would be expected to do so if there is a relative oversupp,y of workers in a particular occupation. Another difficulty is that occupations are only observed for those who work: thus, it may be difficult to measure the population of individuals in a given city who would potentially work in an occupation. Both of these problems can be solved by considering an individual's occupation as a probabilistic outcom that depends on underlying characteristics such as age, education, race, gender, national origin, and *length of time in the country*."},

  abstract={The labor force of each industrial country is being shaped by three forces: ageing, education and migration. Drawing on a new database for the OECD countries and a standard analytical framework, this paper focuses on the relative and aggregate effects of these three forces on wages across different skill and age groups over 2000–2010. The variation in the age and educational structure of the labor force emerges as the dominant influence on wage changes. The impact is uniform and egalitarian: in almost all countries, the changes in the age and skill structure favor the low-skilled and hurt the highly skilled across age groups. Immigration plays a relatively minor role, except in a handful of open countries, like Australia and Canada, where it accentuates the wage-equalizing impact of ageing and education. Emigration is the only inegalitarian influence, especially in Ireland and a few Eastern European countries which have seen significant outflows of high-skilled labor to Western European Union countries.},
